This repository is dedicated to the code/libraries, 3D models, schematics, and PCB gerbers behind FIRST Robotics team **4698**, Rio Robotics. 

The MAX7219 library used is a fork of @squix78's ESP8266 library with a slight modification to the order in which the matrices are drawn onto, as well as utilizing Adafruit's GFX font instead of squix's "cp437" font.

The library used can do the following:

- set pixels
- write text with a simple font
- scroll text left or right 
- oscillate text between the two ends
